# RL-Multi-Agent-Unknown-Obstacles

## What is the project about
This repository is used to test out simulations for Q-Learning that is implemented with Firefly Algorithm's concepts via Netlogo. The base code is all written in Python.

It is used to experiment the feasability of implementing Cooperative Q-Learning Multi-Agent systems with concepts of brightness borrowed from the Firefly Algorithm. Ultimately, to gauge how good does the Bio-Inspired algorithm increase cooperativeness between agents as well as improve training efficiency by lowering iterations needed for agents to reach a goal point.

## How to use it
### Pre-Requisites

2) Create a netlogo file / instance.
3) Pip install all required libraries from requirements.txt via
   ```
   pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
   ```
